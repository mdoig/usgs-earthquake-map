# USGS Earthquake Map

This map, built using Leaflet and Mapbox, visualizes every earthquake recorded by the United States Geological Survey in the past seven days. Additionally, it shows tectonic plate boundaries so users can see how many quakes occur on or near them.

The map utilizes layers to allow users to see two different map views and also to toggle on or off the quake markers and plate boundaries. The legend shows the corresponding color to each quake's recorded magnitude.
